MiniSat v1.12b
========================================

This is the last version where arbitrary boolean constraints are
supported. Later versions of MiniSat only supports clauses. However,
don't be discouraged; the improvements made in v1.13 and v1.14 are
quite easily back-ported to this version, so if you really need the
functionality provided by this release, go ahead and use it (and send
us the upgrades if you make them!)
